// tuples can contain a FIXED number of elements with different data types.

// Declare a tuple named "employee".
// "employee" will contain 2 items, a "number" and a "string"
let employee: [number, string] = [1, "Steve"]

// Update the "employee" tuple with another "number" & "string" combination
employee.push(2, "Bill")
